GitHub Challenge #1: "Say Hello"
This is a console project that will ask a user their name and report it back to them with a greeting.

Peer Reviewed By Carlos Felipe: This program asks for my name and then greets me accordingly. It takes in any input so my name could be "" (essentially nothing) I like that. It means I could be named "XAE - 12" and I would not be judged. I did find a formatting bug however although that's all it is. It is not code breaking material. Overall I like this program, good job.
